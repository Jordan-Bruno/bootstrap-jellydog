# bootstrap-jellydog
A web page built using AI (90%) to demonstrate how students with basic HTML &amp; CSS can guide AI to create structured designs. Inspired by ECDA students' rival company projects, Jellydog was built section-by-section using Bootstrap 5.3.3, Font Awesome 6.7.2, and Midjourney for images, with no JavaScript for simplicity.

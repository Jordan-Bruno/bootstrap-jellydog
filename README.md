# Ecommerce Web Page: A Demonstration for Students
[View Live Website](https://jordan-bruno.github.io/bootstrap-jellydog/)


## 📌 About This Project

This project showcases how **AI can be leveraged** to build an attractive and functional web page with **minimal HTML and CSS knowledge**. Around **90% of this page was generated using AI**, demonstrating that **students with basic web development skills** can use AI as a powerful tool to assist in creating structured and visually appealing designs.

The inspiration for this **Jellycat clone (Jellydog)** came from my students in **ECDA**, who always seem to enjoy creating **rival companies** during class exercises. This project is a fun demonstration of how AI can be used to build an attractive alternative brand website with minimal manual effort.

However, it is important to highlight that **not everything was handled perfectly by AI**. Some sections, such as the **navigation bar, triple-column section, and newsletter form**, required manual fixes. Despite multiple attempts and clear instructions, the AI struggled to achieve the precise desired results, showing that **even with AI assistance, human intervention is often necessary**.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

Through this project, I have identified what I believe to be **a good way** to build a web page using AI:

### 🔹 Section-by-Section Approach (Recommended)

Instead of generating the entire web page at once, this project was **built step by step**, section by section. This approach was crucial because:

- **Maintains control over the layout and functionality**
- **Prevents cascading issues** where fixing one section breaks another
- **Minimises frustration and excessive debugging**
- **Encourages planning and structuring before implementation**

If you **generate everything at once**, making small changes can quickly become a nightmare. One fix can break another part of the design, leading to a never-ending cycle of debugging. **Breaking the design into smaller components** allows for better organisation and **reduces unnecessary rework**.

### 🔹 Reusable Components

Another key takeaway which I did not do at the beginning is to **identify repeated components early**. By structuring the code efficiently and using reusable styles and elements, you can avoid unnecessary repetition, making the codebase **cleaner and more maintainable**.

## 🖌️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Bootstrap 5.3.3** – Provides the base framework, demonstrating that **Bootstrap can look aesthetically pleasing** when combined with a small amount of custom CSS.
- **Font Awesome 6.7.2** – Used for icons to enhance the UI.
- **Midjourney** – All images were AI-generated using Midjourney.
- **No JavaScript** – For simplicity, as the **Digital Development with Python** module does not heavily cover JavaScript, this project focuses purely on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## ⚡ Final Thoughts

This project serves as a **realistic case study** for students who want to explore AI-assisted web development. **AI is an incredibly useful tool, but it is not a replacement for human input**—for now it often struggles with **precision and consistency**. Understanding how to structure and guide AI effectively is key to **maximising productivity** and **reducing frustration**.

By planning ahead, **building section by section**, and identifying reusable components, you can efficiently create a well-structured web page without losing control over the design process.

🚀 **AI is a powerful assistant, but human creativity and problem-solving skills remain essential.**
